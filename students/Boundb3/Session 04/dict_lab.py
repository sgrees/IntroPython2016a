#This is from session 4 of python 100a
#instructinos for a dict and set lab

'''
Learning about dictionaries and sets
Goal:
Learn the basic ins and outs of Python dictionaries and sets.

Procedure
In your student dir in the IntroPython2015 repo, create a session04 dir and put in a new dict_lab.py file.

The file should be an executable python script. That is to say that one should be able to run the script directly like so:

Add the file to your clone of the repository and commit changes frequently while working on the following tasks. When you are done, push your changes to GitHub and issue a pull request.
